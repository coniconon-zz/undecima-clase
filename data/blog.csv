"Data Campfire","antecedente","Data Campfire is a platform for multidisciplinary teams to solve data visualization challenges","<p>Data Campfire is a platform for the data visualisation community, where they collaborate on Data Visualisation Challenges, learn and share. We are developing a platform and service that centres around Stories. Stories are showcases or examples of Data Visualisation projects. Stories contain information about the project including what was made, why it was made and how it was made. From this, others on our platform can understand and learn how to use data with context as well as datasets, tools and software that were used.</p><p>As a core of our business, we host Data Visualisation Events where the data visualisation community work together to solve the problems of organizations. We bring people from different backgrounds; Data Science, Design, Programming, Journalism and many more, so that they produce statistically accurate, and also engaging stories and visuals out of data.</p><p>Organisations who co-host the Events can benefit from getting insights and stories from their data, so that they can make informed decisions and share it across with their audience. Through events and sharing its outputs, they can engage a wider audience with their mission.</p><p>We’re living in a data centric world, but shockingly - less than 0.5% of the data 1 has actually been analysed and used! One of the biggest barriers to utilising data is that there are not enough people with the skills to deal with it. One way to make data accessible to people is to visualise it.Our aim is to unlock the massive potential hidden in these untapped mountains of data around us, to help us better understand our world and communicate more effectively. To achieve this aim, we want to make an accessible Community of Practice for Data Visualisation, with people from a wide variety of disciplines.</p>","images/dcf.png"

His passion is visualising information.</p><p>Communicating data in its raw form can be incredibly difficult to do and the results are often not worth the effort. Graphs and charts are boring and don’t necessarily convey their intended insight.</p><p>McCandless and his team have a mission to distil the world’s data, information and knowledge into beautiful, interesting and above all, useful visualisations, infographics and diagrams.</p>","images/isb.png"
"MIT Media Lab - Collective Learning","referente","Transforming data into knowledge","<p>The Collective Learning group at the MIT Media Lab (formerly called Macro Connections) focuses on how organizations, cities, and nations learn. Research in the Collective Learning group focuses on both the study of collective learning and on the creation of tools that facilitate learning in organizations and nations.</p><p>The Collective Learning group was established as the Macro Connections group in 2010, when professor César A. Hidalgo joined the MIT Media lab. It was renamed the Collective Learning group in 2017. Since 2010, however, this group has has pioneered the study of collective learning in economies–by developing the theory and empirics of economic complexity, and in history–by developing and studying the largest structured dataset on biographical records.</p><p>The Collective Learning group is also renowned for the development of large data visualization engines, which are tools that algorithmically transform data into stories. These visualization engines receive millions of visitors every year and include The Observatory of Economic Complexity, DataUSA (w Datawheel), Immersion, DataViva (w Datawheel), and Pantheon, among others.</p>","images/mit.png"
"The Design Blog","referente","<p>The Design Blog brings you carefully picked high quality inspiration, featuring works of designers from all over the world.","Founded, designed and curated by Ena Baćanović - designer based in Zagreb - Croatia, The Design Blog brings you carefully picked high quality inspiration, featuring works of designers and design studios from all over the world, with the main focus on young designers/ students. Except from the daily inspiration, whole week is filled with different types of inspiring posts and sections that are design-related.</p><p>The Design Blog started up in 2011 as a personal inspiration board of Ena Baćanović, but quickly after that it became clear that this will not be just a personal website. Ena is working really hard to bring the best content to your screen, trying to create the most interesting space for inspiration on the internet.</p>","images/tdb.png"
